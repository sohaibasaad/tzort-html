                    </div>

                    <div class="blog_content">
                        <p class="para my-3">Today I’m happy I get to go back to one of my favorite resorts in the
                            Williamsburg area The Historic Powhatan Resort, which is a Hilton Vacation Club now, has
                            been a vacation destination for myself and my family for well over two decades. The location
                            itself is at 3601 Ironbound Road Williamsburg Virginia, but that puts it very close to Route
                            55 and Route 5 is a road that will get you to Historic Jamestown the Colonial Parkway
                            Colonial Williamsburg, and many other key locations in the area.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">When you’re staying at the resort, you’re so close to all the historic
                            things to do and see in Williamsburg, Jamestown, and Yorktown, but you also have access to
                            Great amusement parks and amazing local golf.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">When you arrive at the resort off Ironbound Road stop briefly at the
                            security gate. Let them know that you’re checking in they’ll direct you to the main building
                            to check in check in as a breeze especially when you booked through Tzort.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">The resort itself offers everything from 1 to 4-bedroom suites and has
                            great on-site pools both indoor and outdoor as well as several on-site restaurants. Over the
                            years when my family came for these mini vacations. We often stayed in a 3 story unit that
                            offered three bedrooms full kitchen an enclosed indoor private hot tub and several
                            bathrooms. the layoffs kind of interesting that the ground floor of the unit for the
                            three-bedroom you walk in the door on the right-hand side there is the kitchen, and it’s a
                            good size kitchen we’re either way that you’re turning there’s a counter either in front of
                            your above hind your dishwasher. An oven full-size refrigerator and plenty of cabinets with
                            all the dishes in cookware that you would need to cook for your family. And over our many
                            visits, over at least a two-decade. We had stayed at the same unit, which is fun because you
                            feel like you get to know the place as a second home and that’s really neat when you’re
                            coming to a resort that you’re so fond of. Cutting the kitchen in the layout of the dining
                            area that’s just in front of the kitchen is very good to make meals while you can still
                            socialize and interact with your family or group that you’re with.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">If you come straight in the door and you don’t turn into the kitchen right
                            in front of you is a small dining area and then after that, there is a large open living
                            room area with a fireplace and TV on one side of the room and large sofas and seating on the
                            other side of the room and then that room leads out onto a patio on one side and on the
                            other side there is in one or two entries into a hot tub area in the hot tub is actually in
                            closed all and attach to this 3 bedroom suite. also on that same ground floor, you have the
                            master bedroom which links not only to the bathroom in the hot tub on either end of the
                            bedroom but has a very sizable king-size bed and a good layout including generous closet
                            space considering that this is a vacation resort.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">A quick step up the stairs they’re all so close to that same front door
                            that you entered in a kind of on a diagonal from the kitchen and you go up to another
                            landing area and in that landing area there’s like another living room type set up but it’s
                            open to the area below and then to the left of that at the top of the stairs there is the
                            other master bedroom and then behind you once you come up the stairs you turn to the right
                            you’ll see another set of stairs going up to the third floor and to the left of those stairs
                            is a full laundry room. returning go up the stairs you find that there is a loft The Loft
                            has two twin beds and is laid out very well, especially for older teens or single
                            individuals to sleep and rest it too was also open to the area below so communicating with
                            the children that are staying up there were the guests that are staying up there.</p>

                            The rooms are very spacious with plenty of comfortable amenities like a soaking tub, a
                            walk-in shower, and small washer, and a dryer. The resort amenities are fun with a nice
                            outdoor and indoor pool area, mini golf, and several playgrounds, including adult-only
                            areas. It’s nice for families. We had a few small problems (fire alarm from the downstairs
                            guest burning food in their kitchen, and our door lock had to be replaced on the second
                            day). Otherwise, it was lovely. The staff was always friendly and prompt.

                            The resort is really beautiful, lovely landscape. The rooms are spacious, comfortable, and
                            well-lit because of the sun’s roofs. Our villa has a clean full kitchen, living room with a
                            fireplace, den, patio, 1 bedroom, walk-in closet, and a bathroom. The bathroom feels a bit,
                            but that’s just how I feel.

                            There are two doors to reach the room, quite effective for keeping bugs away (during summer)
                            and a cold wind (during winter). The staff was friendly too. In the pool area, they have a
                            heated jacuzzi. There’s a kid’s playground down the road for those traveling with children.
                            There are a lot of bugs but that’s expected during the summer in Virginia.

                            The only drawback was the steps. The Master bedroom and bath are very nice. The kitchenette
                            and small dining room connect, but the living room is up another flight of stairs and a
                            little cramped. Quiet rooms, excellent ac, and the washer and dryer combo were very
                            convenient. Wonderful for young and healthy. If you are older or don’t handle stairs well,
                            request a first-floor stay.

                            We loved our unit; 2 bedroom suite. It had everything you could need or want. Very spacious
                            and clean. The only negative was that there is a resort fee and limited parking. Only one
                            assigned space per unit. I was not aware of the fee until I checked in.
                        </p>
                        <p class="para my-3">Definitely will be staying again.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">This is a very large resort, so you have some of the resort kind of on
                            either side of the main road and the main pool and building through the central part of the
                            resort. On the right-hand side, you’ll find the buildings that offer 1 bedroom suites and
                            two-bedroom suites for the most part. And then on the left-hand side of the central part of
                            the resort, you’ll find the larger three and four-bedroom suites that are socially like
                            full-size connected condos in central buildings or townhouses.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">Once you check in and move everything into your unit like your bags your
                            groceries and your goodies for your trip and get everybody settled, you can either start to
                            check the temperature of the hot tub and get ready to jump in or you can head to the
                            community pool or if it’s close enough to your dinner time, you could go to one of the
                            restaurants on site.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">While staying here at the Historic Powhatan, at Hilton Vacation Club, you
                            do have a lot of choices for local restaurants that offer great food, and most have great
                            prices. Unlike many places that serve tourists. I’m always impressed with the fact the local
                            restaurant tours in the area do not overcharge. like any town or area, there are few pricey
                            restaurants but most are very affordable and family-friendly.</p>

                            <h3>Day Two History</h3>
                        </div>

                        <p class="para my-3">More than likely if you’re coming to Williamsburg, part of your trip may be
                            related to the history of the area. If this is your first visit you may want to start with
                            nearby Jamestown and the Jamestown Museum so that you’re starting where the local history
                            and the history of the United States started itself with the Jamestown Colony. After the
                            Jamestown Colony either the same day or the following day whatever works out for your
                            schedule, you can then go to Colonial Williamsburg end see part of the founding City in the
                            capital itself well, in the area also make time to go to Yorktown to see where the
                            Revolutionary War was won, see the local battlefields visit the museums and learn much more
                            first-hand about those amazing Americans that helped win our independence from England.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">I grew up in the area living most of my childhood in Yorktown Virginia how
                            many times a year I would go down to the battlefields just to walk the battlefields or go
                            down to the very nearby Yorktown Beach and actually play and have fun on the beach? but the
                            museums in the area are some of the best in the world and they’re actually cited in historic
                            locations. so when you’re studying and learning about the Revolutionary War, you’re doing so
                            on the actual grounds on which several of the battles were fought. When you were visiting
                            Jamestown is an example. You’re also on a very similar Waterway. It is close to the original
                            site of where the Jamestown Colony. it is evil. Replicas of the church and some of the
                            founding buildings in Jamestown in the Jamestown Fort itself.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">I really enjoy all three of these historic sites, but for different
                            reasons. Colonial Williamsburg is interesting because you get access to these historic
                            sites, including the governor’s mansion and many places where actors are actually acting out
                            the trade early Craftsman right in the original buildings are restored buildings. Then, of
                            course, you have the Cobblestone Road through Colonial Williamsburg and all the shops and
                            all the historic landmarks that you can visit all right there in one location. But the draw
                            to me is different for the Jamestown Settlement Museum because you get a really in-depth
                            understanding of the lives and activities of those that were a part of the Jamestown
                            Settlement. But in Jamestown, you also get access to some really well-done coverage of the
                            lives of the local Indians, and of course, it goes into a lot of the comment historic themes
                            of how the local Indians including Pocahontas and James Smith interacted during those early
                            foundational Days of our nation. Then once I Twilight Jamestown you can also learn how the
                            Indians made Dugout canoes as well as see a ship Builder actually building local boats from
                            local wood sources that were the same type of building methods used for the ships that
                            brought over the settlers for the Jamestown Settlement itself. Also at Jamestown, you can
                            visit the recreated church and Main buildings of the settlement itself and interact with
                            guides and historians who function as actors that also take you through and explain the
                            various buildings and the lives of those early settlers.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">When you visit Yorktown and the various smaYorktown museums, it’s a
                            completely different feeling because you’re on the actual battlegrounds and in the area
                            where the Revolutionary War took place, there are really good films exhibits that explain in
                            detail what the fighting was like what occurred there on the site and many of the different
                            battles and conflicts that the Revolutionary Heroes had to struggle through in order to gain
                            their independence. So the Yorktown battlefields and museums have a different feeling
                            because the focus is more on the war and the path to Independence but also while you are
                            there you can visit Yorktown Beach which is a nice ll Beach it’s right in front of that
                            historic area just within walking distance.</p>

                            <h3>Day Three Busch Gardens</h3>
                        </div>
                        <p class="para my-3">While you’re staying at the Powhatan Plantation if you are with the family
                            and could afford to do so, most visitors prefer to go to Busch Gardens while they are here.
                            Busch Gardens is a giant theme park that is built in themed in kind of large oval a large
                            circle with many countries being represented and a little Village all around that Circle so
                            as you come into the park and start to walk from one area to the next you get to experience
                            different architecture and cultures from around most of Europe. It makes the park really
                            special and unique because of how it’s themed and how all the rides and entertainment and
                            food follow that pattern and it makes for a very fun layout for a park. having grown up in
                            the area, I’ve had the pleasure of going to Busch Gardens probably over a hundred times in
                            my lifetime. I also spent one summer working there as a child and I worked in the kitchens
                            of Italy and got to see behind the scenes quite literally how the sausage is made and
                            preparing the meals in that nation of Italy.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">Know before you go that Busch Gardens has some options that make it easy to
                            get around, but it does involve a good deal of walking, and some of that walking will be
                            uphill and downhill. so if you are taking the grandparents with you or if you have someone
                            who has special needs, keep in mind that there will be a good deal of walking and some of
                            that will be inclined or declined. now there are options to decrease the amount of walking
                            that you have to do there is a train that goes around most of the park and you can get off
                            at several spots so you can get on that train from one of the train stations and take it to
                            the next area and do that 4 * see the 3 or 4 times throughout the park itself and that does
                            make things easier. If you remember your party does you not want to walk a great deal but
                            you are mobile enough, you can also use the Skylift which will take you from one section of
                            a park to the other and you could get on the first Sky Lift or chairlift right after you
                            enter the park if you enter the park you’ll see that you come into the country of England
                            and if you go off to the right to head out of the park and start walking on the walkway on
                            your left is one of the first Sky lives or chair lifts and that cheerless will take you all
                            the way across the park to France from where you are in England.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">if you’re okay with walking though you can walk the circumference of this
                            park probably in an hour or less as long as you’re okay with those walking points where you
                            got kind of steep inclines or declines. just like any other Circle you can go either
                            direction you like most people go to the right and go on the natural course around that
                            Circle but you could go in the opposite direction as well and sometimes it’s a good choice
                            if the park is particularly busy that day.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">add Busch Gardens. You’ll find many major roller coasters but they also
                            have quite a number of smaller rides for those who aren’t roller coaster fanatics. The park
                            also does an excellent job of providing many shows with incredibly talented dancers and
                            singers. end throughout the park, you will find great food that is themed for the nation
                            that you’re in. one of the most popular locations to eat, drink and be merry is the Fest
                            house in Germany. Here you will find many draft beers as well as German meals in German
                            desserts. the fast house itself is a giant-scale dining and entertainment venue where you
                            can come in and sit at very large picnic-style tables together in an air-conditioned
                            building around the central building there is a stage where live music and bands play.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">just outside of the Fest house itself you will find local carnival games
                            which are always fun for the kids to play or for the dad to try to win the kid’s surprises
                            but just going to plan your trip here strategically because you don’t want to win a large
                            prize and then have to carry it around for the second half of your day. so if you come to
                            the Fest house to eat for lunch or for an early dinner and the kids see the games let them
                            know that you’ll come back to the games and you’ll play in a little while and you can take
                            them right around the corner from the games and the right bumper cars and ride some other
                            smaller rides and that works as a great discredit distraction from those carnival games for
                            the kids for a while.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">Not far from Germany in the Gasthaus area, you can go over to Italy Italy
                            has more small rides and they also have a large water ride and a very large coaster. the
                            coaster that you’re fine here though is not for the faint of heart it’s called Apollo’s
                            Chariot and it has quite a drop if you go into Little Italy from the main part of Italy you
                            can actually go close to one of the water rides and look at the drop-in watch people ride
                            that coaster over that Giant Drop. I am not much of a roller coaster ride anyway but once I
                            saw that drop I knew that I would never be going on Apollo’s Chariot. but in the Little
                            Italy area and Italy itself there are many rides that I will ride and enjoy that are smaller
                            rides that cycle pretty quickly so even if there’s a bit of a line you really don’t have to
                            wait for those rides long. There are also two large water rides in the area one is an indoor
                            Flume-like ride that has dancing fire in many things going on around you in a theme setting
                            and then a large drop at the end and the other is a Roman Rapids experience that goes
                            through a large water weigh and has water coming down on you and it’s almost like a ride on
                            a natural rapid through jungles and surrounding Forest fauna.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">Another neat thing about many of these countries that you can visit
                            throughout the park is the opportunity to take some really neat photos and have some great
                            selfies or family photos that you can take with your phones in unique settings. what are the
                            opportunities you’ll find off to the left as you’re heading from Italy to Little Italy is a
                            large winemaking that where you go in and you act out the Stomping of the grapes and it
                            makes for wonderful photos and gives you a good opportunity to take that family shot while
                            you’re on vacation.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">Another amazing thing about Busch Gardens is the live entertainment. Not
                            only do they have several shows every season but they also welcome Live musical acts from
                            National groups and individual talent. Over the many years in my visits, I’ve enjoyed many
                            live Acts from all different types of musical backgrounds and you can get up close and
                            personal with some of the seating being just 10 feet or fewer from the stage.</p>
                        <p class="para my-3">If you like theme park rides entertainment music and unique food, this is
                            an amazing Park and a great experience for the entire family really, Busch Gardens. There’s
                            something for everyone to see it a joy. If you were here in the area close to the Christmas
                            holiday season one thing that you may want to make sure to check out is Christmas Town. this
                            is when Busch Gardens becomes an entire Christmas experience for that area of England that
                            you enter in the first two and Germany all become Christmas-themed and they really do an
                            excellent job. Busch Gardens, that self has changed hands from the Anheuser-Busch company to
                            the company that now owns all the Busch Gardens amusement parks or theme parks. I was at
                            Christmas Town for their very first year with my family and joy did a great deal in the
                            evening years since it is only gotten better and better every single season. if you get the
                            opportunity to experience it, not only is it a good buffet-style meal but you get some
                            almost 101 times with Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus for your child and it gives you the
                            opportunity to take photos of videos of that experience and its unique if they’re the right
                            age and still are big fans of Santa and Christmas time fun.</p>
